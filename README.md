# CONTENT
I wanted to create a site with 3 main parts:
1. Showing the multiple facets of me in the hero banner (developer, engineer and artist), and have an animation (in the form of parallax) to invite the viewer to come into my world.

2. Displaying information about:
* me (a short paragraph about me, my prior professional experience and my skills)
* my portfolio (with an emphasis on being a **dual** stack developer, with *Ruby on Rails* and *MEAN* projects), and finally
* my art and community engagement

3. Inviting the viewer to contact me in this beautiful city of Melbourne. The use of parallax sets the scene in motion; adding the movement of the tram incites the viewer to come and connect with me.

# TECHNICAL CHALLENGES

* Creating a set of routes to direct user to numerous pages
* Using parallax in the hero banner and the footer to engage the viewer to 'enter' the site and to 'come' and contact me when reaching the end of the webpage.
