  <div class="about-description">
    <p>&nbsp;I’m Carole, an international traveler with a persistent French accent. Polymath at heart, I love to constantly explore new horizons. Once upon a time a chemical engineer, a personal trainer, a workshop provider and a quarantine officer, gives me the skills to communicate and relate with people of different cultures and backgrounds.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;I’m now learning code to build full stack products for the internet. I enjoy crafting pretty things and nifty solutions to complicated problems.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Extracurricular activities involve thin air, like flying, and more breathable air for rollerblading, drawing cartoons and anything fibre related!</p>
