    <div class="about-description">
      <p>&nbsp;This project started from the need to collect effectively routine quarantine data at the various points of entry of Tasmania.</p>
  	  <p>&nbsp;Data were collected manually and entered, at best of times, in an excel spreadsheet.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;In order to have a real-time data feed of the activities happening at the border I designed a user interface. Users were comprised of a variety of stakeholders: field-officers, program managers, operational managers and relevant governmental bodies</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Iâ€™ve designed the relational database underpinning the back-end component of the project.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;The front-end followed the biosecurity continuum paradigm, with pre-border, border and post-border activities.</p>
